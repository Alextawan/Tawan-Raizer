In that time I had no idea what he was saying but it looked so cool. For the past few years I have studied coding as I wanted. I have a strong passion for coding and my dream is to become a good and talented programmer.</p>
                    
                    <p>I think that the Bachelor of Science Program in Informatics for Digital Economy at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok International Program will help me to succeed my dream because in this faculty there are many teachers who are experts in technology and famous in programming.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe that the University of Technology North Bangkok will give me more skills and knowledge of IT that is important for me to become a good programmer and I hope that I could be in the University to improve myself.</p>
